\section{Appendix}

Here all theorems or general concepts that have been used in the report and seek further explanation should be placed.\\[3pt]
Note that the references come before the appendix. The references need to be written in .bib format, see the attached file references.bib. Then you should compile three times the document with bibTex and other three times with LatexMk (or simply Latex) and they should normally appear into the text automatically.

\section{Response Approximation}

In the deterministic finite element method, the solution of the boundary value problem is approximated in functional space spanned by the shape functions, which reduces the problem to determining the coefficients of these functions. 
In a similar way, one can approximate a function of random variables in a functional space spanned by basis functions in terms of the input random variables.

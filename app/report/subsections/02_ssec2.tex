\subsection{Rational Polynomial Chaos Expansion}

Another approach is to approximate the response as a ratio between two linear combinations of a set of basis functions:

\begin{equation}
    U_{i}(\omega,\mathbf{x}) =
    \frac{
        \sum_{p=1}^{P} U_{ip}(\omega) \cdot \Psi_{p}(\mathbf{x})
    }{
        \sum_{q=1}^{Q} U_{iq}(\omega) \cdot \Psi_{q}(\mathbf{x})
    }
\label{RPCE}
\end{equation}

The basis functions used in Rational Polynomial Chaos Expansion (RPCE) is the same functions used in PCE.

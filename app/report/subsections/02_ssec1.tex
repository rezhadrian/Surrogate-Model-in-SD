\subsection{Polynomial Chaos Expansion}

Polynomial Chaos Expansion (PCE) approximates the response as a linear combination of a set of basis functions: 

\begin{equation}
    \mathbf{U}(\omega,\mathbf{x}) =
    \sum_{p=1}^{P} \mathbf{U}_{p}(\omega)\cdot\Psi_{p}(\mathbf{x})
\label{PCE}
\end{equation}

The basis functions are products of polynomial functions. 
The polynomials are chosen such that each pair is statistically independent. 
In addition, the polynomials can be normalised such that their covariance is the identity matrix.

\begin{equation}
    \Psi_{p}(\mathbf{x}) = 
    \prod_{\alpha=1}^{d} \psi_{p_{\alpha}} \left(x_{\alpha}\right)
    \phantom{x}
    ;
    \phantom{x}
    \int_{\Omega_{x}} \psi_{i}(x)\phantom{.}\psi_{j}(x) \cdot f_{X}(x) \phantom{.} dx =
    \delta_{ij}
\label{PCE Basis}
\end{equation}
